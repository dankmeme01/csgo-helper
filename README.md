# csgo-helper

A (somewhat) small program that can help you enhance your CS:GO experience. Includes different things that would have taken you some time to install manually, such as Simple Radar, CS:GO telnet client, saving & loading configs and multiple more things.

## Usage

No need for installing anything, just grab the latest .exe file and run it. Then you will be presented with a CLI where you can enter commands.

## Credits

Special thanks to all the dependencies that this program relies on, such as libcurl. And separate thanks for [this project](https://github.com/TinyTinni/ValveFileVDF) for an easy-to-use VDF parser.
